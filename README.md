# Solarbit Pool Server Prototype A

A quick UDP server in Erlang to test the SMM on the Arduino.

Still working this up - will document when it becomes useful.

Probably, this will end up being a Rust implementation.

Uses the draft SMM [Protocol](https://github.com/solarbit/arduino/blob/master/protocol.md)
